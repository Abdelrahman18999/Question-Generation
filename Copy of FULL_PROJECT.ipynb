understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["cleaned_text =

vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}],"source":["cleand_txt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Step-2

recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images.', 'In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding.', 'Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene.', 'Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a

['Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems.', 'This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks.'], 'machine vision': ['A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them.', 'This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity.', 'It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images.', 'Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process.', 'Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.59 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the definition of computer vision?', 'no_ans_gap': 7.777004718780518, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.8102098703384399, 'context': 'nd machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity.

These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.56 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the role of the input to a device for computer interaction?', 'no_ans_gap': 3.7462074756622314, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'Interaction', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.7362797260284424, 'context': 'sual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModelin', 'offsets_in_document': [{'start': 13965, 'end': 13976}], 'offsets_in_context': [{'start': 70, 'end': 81}], 'document_id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba', 'meta': {}}>, <Answer {'answer': 'Highlevel processing', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.42317041754722595, 'context': 'ground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for e', 'offsets_in_document': [{'start': 27996, 'end': 28016}], 'offsets_in_context': [{'start': 65, 'end': 85}], 'document_id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba', 'meta': {}}>, <Answer {'answer': 'camera', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.3860210180282593, 'context': 'ed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished com', 'offsets_in_document': [{'start': 2815, 'end': 2821}], 'offsets_in_context': [{'start': 72, 'end': 78}], 'document_id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba', 'meta': {}}>], 'documents': [<Document: {'content': \"Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos.

Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.58 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the definition of computer vision?', 'no_ans_gap': 7.777004718780518, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.8102098703384399, 'context': 'nd machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions.

This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications.

This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.58 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the definition of computer vision?', 'no_ans_gap': 7.777004718780518, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.8102098703384399, 'context': 'nd machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.58 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'what is computer vision?', 'no_ans_gap': 12.064177989959717, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'signal processing', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.8078794479370117, 'context': 'ful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing.

Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.56 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the definition of computer vision?', 'no_ans_gap': 7.777004718780518, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.8102098703384399, 'context': 'nd machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity.

Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.57 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'what is the definition of a medical scanner?', 'no_ans_gap': -0.41315317153930664, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'multidimensional data', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.43759292364120483, 'context': ' forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands.

Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events.

In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.56 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the overlap between computer vision and photogrammetry?', 'no_ans_gap': -1.383373498916626, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'Solidstate physics', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.2715141475200653, 'context': 'cation, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision.

In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.56 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the overlap between computer vision and photogrammetry?', 'no_ans_gap': -1.383373498916626, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'Solidstate physics', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.2715141475200653, 'context': 'cation, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions.

This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them.

Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.55 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the definition of a segmentation of a particular image region?', 'no_ans_gap': -1.9556488990783691, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.52 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the most common use of machine vision in agriculture?', 'no_ans_gap': 4.975944995880127, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.5929654836654663, 'context': 'sion is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the new', 'offsets_in_document': [{'start': 15733, 'end': 15784}], 'offsets_in_context': [{'start': 50, 'end': 101}], 'document_id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba', 'meta': {}}>, <Answer {'answer': 'high running machineries', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.2927124500274658, 'context': 'image sequence.

Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.54 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What are the most common problems with digital cameras?', 'no_ans_gap': 4.103896617889404, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'images that have been distorted with filters', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.7315353155136108, 'context': 'g a quill in their hand.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics.

It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.52 Batches/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the most important part of the field of machine vision?', 'no_ans_gap': 6.168446063995361, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'automated image analysis', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.8963999152183533, 'context': 'ificant overlap.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires.

The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples areResampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features areLines, edges and ridges.Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detectionsegmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples areSelection of a specific set of interest points.Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts also referred to as spatialtaxon scene hierarchy, while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.Segmentation or cosegmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of perframe foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.Highlevel processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for exampleVerification that the data satisfy modelbased and applicationspecific assumptions.Estimation of applicationspecific parameters, such as object pose or object size.Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for examplePassfail on automatic inspection applications.Matchnomatch in recognition applications.Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.Imageunderstanding systemsImageunderstanding systems IUS include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '225a3fd135d4f96f946f4b7d113459ba'}>], 'root_node': 'Query', 'params': {'Retriever': {'top_k': 10}, 'Reader': {'top_k': 5}}, 'node_id': 'Reader'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  1.53 Batches/s]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'query': 'What is the definition of a diagnostic image?', 'no_ans_gap': 0.3954195976257324, 'answers': [<Answer {'answer': 'multidimensional data from a medical scanner', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': 0.32954439520835876, 'context': ' as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multidimensional data from a D scanner, or medical scanning device. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.Subdomains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, D scene modeling, and image restoration.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain highlevel understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multidimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.In the late s, computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In , it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract threedimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, nonpolyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scalespace, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields. By the s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multiview stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see Eigenface. Toward the end of the s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included imagebased rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early lightfield rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of featurebased methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.Solidstate physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infrared light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.Neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how real vision systems operate in order to solve certain visionrelated tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learningbased methods developed within computer vision e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in biology.Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fieldsYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing of onevariable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of twovariable signals or multivariable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in processing of onevariable signals. Together with the multidimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing highlevel information about the environment and the robot.Beside the abovementioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industryThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even a behaviour of a computer system based on such understanding.Computer graphics produces image data from D models, computer vision often produces D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally acceptedImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixelwise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processinganalysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.Computer vision includes D analysis from D images. This analyzes the D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imagingbased automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., visionbased robots and systems for visionbased inspection, measurement, or picking such as bin picking. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that realtime processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computervision applications, the computers are preprogrammed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems forLearning D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct D shapes from single or multiview depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently.Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applicationsAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification systemControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robotDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industryInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computerhuman interactionModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modelingNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robotOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.Tracking surfaces or planes in D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or Xray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, landbased vehicles small robots with wheels, cars or trucks, aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles UAV. The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where computervisionbased systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment SLAM, for detecting obstacles andor automatically ensuring navigational safety. It can also be used for detecting certain taskspecific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu rover.Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting micro undulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins is being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data of the imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.Other application areas includeSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking matchmoving.Surveillance.Driver drowsiness detectionTracking and counting organisms in the biological sciencesEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less welldefined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of highdimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.Object recognition also called object classification – one or several prespecified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their D positions in the image or D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide standalone programs that illustrate this functionality.Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and  object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras. By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into finegrained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.citation neededSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such asContentbased image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image give me all images similar to image X by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of highlevel search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them.Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centresPose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.Optical character recognition OCR – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing e.g. ASCII.D code reading – reading of D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.Facial recognitionShape Recognition Technology SRT in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objectsMotion analysisSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks areEgomotion – determining the D rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.Tracking – following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.Scene reconstructionGiven one or typically more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete D surface model. The advent of D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Gridbased D sensing can be used to acquire D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple D images together into point clouds and D models.Image restorationThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise, motion blur, etc. from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as lowpass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.An example in this field is inpainting.The organization of a computer vision system is highly applicationdependent. Some systems are standalone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a subsystem of a larger design which, for example, also contains subsystems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, manmachine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is prespecified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of lightsensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultrasonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary D image, a D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images, but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.Preprocessing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method.
